## Running against development/staging

You can simply start the storybook with the `CHROMATIC_INDEX_URL` set, as you would with the chromatic CLI:

```bash
CHROMATIC_INDEX_URL=https://www.staging-chromatic.com yst
```

This will also work if you are running a canary/etc against an external storybook.
