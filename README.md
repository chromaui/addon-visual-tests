# Storybook Visual Testing addon

The Visual Testing addon enables you to run visual tests on your stories and compare changes with the latest baselines across multiple viewports and browsers to catch UI regressions early in development without leaving Storybook.

## Prerequisites

- Chromatic [account configured](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/setup#sign-up) with access to a project
- Storybook 7.2 or later

## Getting Started

Run the following command to install the addon and automatically configure it for your project via Storybook's CLI:

```shell
npx storybook add @chromatic-com/storybook
```

Start Storybook and navigate to the Visual Tests panel to run your first visual test with Chromatic!

## Configuration

By default, the addon offers zero-config support to run visual tests with Storybook and Chromatic. However, you can extend your configuration via a `chromatic.config.json` file and provide additional options to control how tests are run. Check out the [docs](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/visual-tests-addon/) to learn about the various options that can be configured.

### Updating the GraphQL schema

The addon uses the Chromatic public GraphQL API. We rely on its schema to generate type definitions. The schema needs to be manually updated whenever it changes.
To update, take https://github.com/chromaui/chromatic/blob/main/lib/schema/public-schema.graphql and save it under `src/gql/public-schema.graphql`.

## Troubleshooting

### Running Storybook with the addon enabled throws an error

When installed, running Storybook may lead to the following error:

```shell
const stringWidth = require('string-width');

Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]: require() of ES Module /my-project/node_modules/string-width/index.js is not supported.
```

This is a [known issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/22431#issuecomment-1630086092) when using an older version of the Yarn package manager (e.g., version 1.x). To solve this issue, you can [upgrade](https://yarnpkg.com/migration/guide) to the latest stable version. However, if you cannot upgrade, adjust your `package.json` file and provide a resolution field to enable the Yarn package manager to install the correct dependencies. In doing so, you may be required to delete your `node_modules` directory and `yarn.lock` file before installing the dependencies again.

```json
 "resolutions": {
    "jackspeak": "2.1.1"
  }
```

Alternatively, you could use a different package manager ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)).
